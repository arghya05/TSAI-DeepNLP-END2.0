1. [Very Basics](01_VeryBasics)

    This describes all the basics of a neural network, how gradient descent works, learning rate, fully connected neurons, chain rule, etc.

2. [BackProp](02_BackProp/README.html)

    We built a Neural Network in a damn spreadsheet :)

3. [PyTorch 101](03_PyTorch101/README.html)

    Basics of PyTorch. Here i built a custom MNIST model, that can classify MNIST Image as well as do addition of that predicted image with a random integer.

4. [RNN & LSTMS](04_RNN_LSTM/README.md)

    Built an LSTM From Scratch and Trained an IMDb Sentiment analysis classifier using RNN & LSTM with PyTorch Text.

5. [LSTM & NLP Augmentation](05_NLP_Augment/README.html)

    Trained a LSTM Model on the SST Dataset. And did a lot of NLP Augmentations.
