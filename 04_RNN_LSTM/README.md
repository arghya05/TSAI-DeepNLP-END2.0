# RNN & LSTM

## Assignment

Assignment: 

- Refer to the file we wrote in the [class](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xwX32O0WYOqcCROJnnJiSdzScPCudAM?usp=sharing): Rewrite this code, but this time remove RNN and add LSTM. 

- Refer to this [file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Pciev6dvYBJ7KxwSHruG-XMwcoj0SfJ). 

  - The questions this time are already mentioned in the file. Take as much time as you want (but less than 7 days), to solve the file. Once you are done, then write your solutions in the quiz. 

  - Please note that the Session 4 Assignment Solution will time out after 15 minutes, as you just have to copy-paste your answers.

ðŸ˜¢  I messed up the Quiz Again, forgot to set the hidden size to 100 for the above cells, only did it for the last training cells.

NOTES:

- The PyTorch Text codes shared above is really outdated, i need to follow up on [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html) and rewrite the code for my sanity.
